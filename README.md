You Are There
===========

This was the first iOS app I produces and published entirely by myself. It was made for trips to unfamiliar places. The user sets destination points on the map and then he or she can sit back; the app raises a notification when the user arrives at their destination. 

Core technologies:  
- Core Location
- Google Maps
